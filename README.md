Hello AlexS

Almost a year ago, fate reminded us that there will always be those who wish us harm. But no less evil we could awaken in ourselves, trying to stop them. When someone takes away the people we love, our first reaction is to seek revenge, but we're not really like that. Today we are gathered here to send a new expedition to the USS Enterprise and honor the memory of those who sacrificed their lives in one of the darkest days of our history. Handing me the ship, Christopher pike made me say the captain's oath. At the time, I did not treat it with due respect, but today I understand that this oath is a call to us, a call to remember who we were and who we must become again.
